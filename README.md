# Trespass

A digital waiver for property owners to be able to allow their property to be used for recreation without exposing themselves to legal trouble. Recreational users will agree to be responsible for their own activity in exchange for access to the property.

In other words, an Airbnb for campgrounds and off road vehicles.

Trespass is written in Rails and uses Rails templates for the web pages. Future plans include a React overhaul and adding Stripe Checkout.

You can check out and run this project for yourself. Simply clone this repo, run `bundle install` and then `rails s`.
